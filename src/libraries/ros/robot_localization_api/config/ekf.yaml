        # omputation until it receives at least one message from one of the inputs. It will then run continuously at the
        # requency specified here, regardless of whether it receives more measurements. Defaults to 30 if unspecified.
        frequency: 30.0

        # he period, in seconds, after which we consider a sensor to have timed out. In this event, we carry out a predict
        # ycle on the EKF without correcting it. This parameter can be thought of as the minimum frequency with which the
        # ilter will generate new output. Defaults to 1 / frequency if not specified.
        sensor_timeout: 0.1

        # kf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node both use a 3D omnidirectional motion model. If this parameter is
        # et to true, no 3D information will be used in your state estimate. Use this if you are operating in a planar
        # nvironment and want to ignore the effect of small variations in the ground plane that might otherwise be detected
        # y, for example, an IMU. Defaults to false if unspecified.
        two_d_mode: false

        # se this parameter to provide an offset to the transform generated by ekf_localization_node. This can be used for
        # uture dating the transform, which is required for interaction with some other packages. Defaults to 0.0 if
        # nspecified.
        transform_time_offset: 0.0

        # nhappy with any settings or data.
        print_diagnostics: true

        # ebug settings. Not for the faint of heart. Outputs a ludicrous amount of information to the file specified by
        # ebug_out_file. I hope you like matrices! Please note that setting this to true will have strongly deleterious
        # ffects on the performance of the node. Defaults to false if unspecified.
        debug: false

        # efaults to "robot_localization_debug.txt" if unspecified. Please specify the full path.

        # ========================================================= Frames ========================================================= #
        
        # EP-105 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html) specifies four principal coordinate frames: base_link, odom, map, and
        # arth. base_link is the coordinate frame that is affixed to the robot. Both odom and map are world-fixed frames.
        # he robot's position in the odom frame will drift over time, but is accurate in the short term and should be
        # ontinuous. The odom frame is therefore the best frame for executing local motion plans. The map frame, like the odom
        # rame, is a world-fixed coordinate frame, and while it contains the most globally accurate position estimate for your
        # obot, it is subject to discrete jumps, e.g., due to the fusion of GPS data or a correction from a map-based
        # ocalization node. The earth frame is used to relate multiple map frames by giving them a common reference frame.
        # kf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node are not concerned with the earth frame.
        # ere is how to use the following settings:
        # . Set the map_frame, odom_frame, and base_link frames to the appropriate frame names for your system.
        #     1a. If your system does not have a map_frame, just remove it, and make sure "world_frame" is set to the value of
        #         odom_frame.
        # . If you are fusing continuous position data such as wheel encoder odometry, visual odometry, or IMU data, set
        #   "world_frame" to your odom_frame value. This is the default behavior for robot_localization's state estimation nodes.
        # . If you are fusing global absolute position data that is subject to discrete jumps (e.g., GPS or position updates
        # rom landmark observations) then:
        #     3a. Set your "world_frame" to your map_frame value
        #     3b. MAKE SURE something else is generating the odom->base_link transform. Note that this can even be another state
        #         estimation node from robot_localization! However, that instance should *not* fuse the global data.
        map_frame: map                      # efaults to "map" if unspecified
        odom_frame: odom                    # efaults to "odom" if unspecified
        base_link_frame: base_link          # efaults to "base_link" if unspecified
        world_frame: odom                   # efaults to the value of odom_frame if unspecified

        # eometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped, geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped,
        # ensor_msgs/Imu). To add an input, simply append the next number in the sequence to its "base" name, e.g., odom0,
        # dom1, twist0, twist1, imu0, imu1, imu2, etc. The value should be the topic name. These parameters obviously have no
        # efault values, and must be specified.

        # ach sensor reading updates some or all of the filter's state. These options give you greater control over which
        # alues from each measurement are fed to the filter. For example, if you have an odometry message as input, but only
        # ant to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry. The order of the
        # alues is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some message types
        # o not provide some of the state variables estimated by the filter. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message
        # as no pose information, so the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false
        # f unspecified, effectively making this parameter required for each sensor.

        # lgorithm.
        odom0_nodelay: false

        # [ADVANCED] When measuring one pose variable with two sensors, a situation can arise in which both sensors under-
        # eport their covariances. This can lead to the filter rapidly jumping back and forth between each measurement as they
        # rrive. In these cases, it often makes sense to (a) correct the measurement covariances, or (b) if velocity is also
        # easured by one of the sensors, let one sensor measure pose, and the other velocity. However, doing (a) or (b) isn't
        # lways feasible, and so we expose the differential parameter. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose
        # ata is converted to velocity data by differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then
        # ntegrated as usual. NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide pose measurements; setting differential to true
        # or twist measurements has no effect.
        odom0_differential: false

        # [ADVANCED] When the node starts, if this parameter is true, then the first measurement is treated as a "zero point"
        # or all future measurements. While you can achieve the same effect with the differential paremeter, the key
        # ifference is that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before
        # ntegrating it. If you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true.
        odom0_relative: false

        # [ADVANCED] If your data is subject to outliers, use these threshold settings, expressed as Mahalanobis distances, to
        # ontrol how far away from the current vehicle state a sensor measurement is permitted to be. Each defaults to
        # umeric_limits<double>::max() if unspecified. It is strongly recommended that these parameters be removed if not
        # equired. Data is specified at the level of pose and twist variables, rather than for each variable in isolation.

        # ====================================================== Control input ===================================================== #

        # [ADVANCED]  The EKF and UKF models follow a standard predict/correct cycle. During prediction, if there is no
        # cceleration reference, the velocity at time t+1 is simply predicted to be the same as the velocity at time t. During
        # orrection, this predicted value is fused with the measured value to produce the new velocity estimate. This can be
        # roblematic, as the final velocity will effectively be a weighted average of the old velocity and the new one. When
        # his velocity is the integrated into a new pose, the result can be sluggish covergence. This effect is especially
        # oticeable with LIDAR data during rotations. To get around it, users can try inflating the process_noise_covariance
        # or the velocity variable in question, or decrease the  variance of the variable in question in the measurement
        # tself. In addition, users can also take advantage of the control command being issued to the robot at the time we
        # ake the prediction. If control is used, it will get converted into an acceleration term, which will be used during
        # redicition. Note that if an acceleration measurement for the variable in question is available from one of the
